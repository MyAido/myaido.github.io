# Aido: AI Accessibility Assistant for Android

## Mission
Aido allows users to access powerful AI tools (rephrasing, translation, smart replies) directly inside any Android application without switching screens. It acts as a smart overlay powered by Android's Accessibility Services.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. AI Writer
- **Function**: Generates text based on prompts.
- **Trigger**: Users type a prompt and select "AI Write" from the floating menu.
- **Use Cases**: Writing emails, drafting posts, generating code snippets.

### 2. Smart Replies
- **Function**: Analyzes incoming messages and suggests context-aware replies.
- **Trigger**: Tapping a received message bubble.
- **Privacy**: Text is processed locally or sent to the API only upon user action.

### 3. Font Library (New)
- **Function**: Converts normal text into stylized Unicode fonts (e.g., 𝐁𝐨𝐥𝐝, 𝑆𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑡).
- **Trigger**: Typing specific triggers like `@b` (Bold) or `@s` (Script).
- **Format**: Supports custom `.aidofont` files for sharing styles.

## Technical Context & Safety
- **Accessibility Service**: Aido uses this permission *strictly* to read the text field where the user is typing (to perform replacements) and screen content only when the user explicitly triggers an AI action.
- **Privacy**: No keylogging. No continuous data transmission. Data is ephemeral and action-driven.
- **Malware Clarification**: Aido is a legitimate productivity tool, not malware. It requires high-level permissions solely to function as an overlay assistant.
